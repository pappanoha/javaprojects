Learning Java, projects that were completed in 2021. 
Sentiment Analysis project. 
1. For the base assignment, you will ask the user to enter a word, and then you will search
every movie review for that word. If you find it, add the score for that review to the wordâ€™s running score total 
(i.e., an accumulator variable). You also will need to keep track of how many appearances the word made so that you can report 
the average score of reviews containing that word back to the user. 
(Note, averages are real numbers, not integers.)
2.(10 points) Ask the user to give you the name of a file (example: XYZ.txt) containing a series of words, one-per-line, and compute 
the score of every word in the file. Report back to the user the average score of the words in the file. This will allow you to predict 
the overall sentiment of the phrase represented by words in the file. Consider an average word score above 2.01 as an overall positive 
sentiment and consider average score below 1.99 to have an overall negative sentiment.
3. Ask the user to give you the name of a file containing a series of words, one-per- line, and compute the score of every word 
in the file. Report back to the user which word was the most positive and which was the most negative. 
4. (10 points) Create a menu that allows the user to pick the functionality that they want from the choices. When finished with it, 
present the menu again until the user chooses to exit. A sample run of the menu might look like this. (Note that the menu also includes the bonus option, discussed next.) (Note that item 4 is for the optional bonus. Please include 4 in your menu, but it is ok that a request for 4 does nothing.) The user should be forced to enter a valid number: 1-5.
